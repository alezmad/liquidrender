ROUNDTRIP EQUIVALENCE VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Definition:
  Original DSL → parseUI() → LiquidSchema
  → compileUI() → Compiled DSL
  → parseUI() → Reconstructed Schema
  Compare: Original Schema ≈ Reconstructed Schema

Verification Method:
  1. Parse original DSL with parseUI()
  2. Compile schema with compileUI()
  3. Re-parse compiled DSL with parseUI()
  4. Compare schemas with compareUISchemas()
  5. Check isEquivalent flag

Results:
  All 5 snippets: ✓ 100% EQUIVALENT
  No structural mismatches
  No semantic differences
  All modifiers preserved
  All bindings preserved
  All colors preserved
  All component types normalized correctly

================================================================================
COMPILATION TRANSFORMATIONS
================================================================================

Component Type Codes:
  Kp → 1     ✓ Working
  Br → 2     ✓ Working
  Ln → 3     ✓ Working
  Tb → 5     ✓ Working
  Tx → Tx    ✓ Preserved as-is

Protocol Normalization:
  sse:// → https://  ✓ Working (semantically equivalent)
  ws:// → ws://      ✓ Preserved as-is
  ~5s → ~5s          ✓ Preserved as-is
  ~1m → ~1m          ✓ Preserved as-is

Label Handling:
  Quoted labels preserved with quotes
  Example: "BTC Live" → "BTC Live" ✓

Field Bindings:
  Simple: :price → :price ✓
  Nested: :summary.activeUsers → :summary.activeUsers ✓

Color Syntax:
