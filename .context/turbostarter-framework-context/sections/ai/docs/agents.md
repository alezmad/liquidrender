# Agents

<Callout title="Agents are coming soon!">
  This feature is currently under development and will be
  available in a future release.

  [See roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/turbostarter/projects/1)
</Callout>

The AI Agents demo will showcase how to create intelligent, autonomous agents capable of executing complex tasks within your web and mobile applications.

These agents will leverage advanced AI techniques to interact with users, tools, and data sources.

## Features

<Cards>
  <Card title="Cross-platform">
    Design agents once and deploy them seamlessly across multiple platforms
    including React, React Native, Expo, and Next.js through a unified
    architecture.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Memory">
    Implement sophisticated context retention that allows agents to maintain
    state and recall critical information across conversations and devices with
    perfect continuity.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Function calling">
    Enable agents to take meaningful actions by integrating with external tools,
    accessing APIs, and executing functions dynamically within secure,
    controlled environments.
  </Card>

  <Card title="MCP integration">
    Leverage the [Model Context
    Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) to standardize
    context delivery between agents and Large Language Models (LLMs). This
    enables frictionless connections to diverse data sources and tools,
    dramatically enhancing agent capabilities.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Agentic workflows">
    Orchestrate complex workflows combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    (RAG), tool utilization, and MCP server interactions to solve sophisticated
    tasks that previously required human intervention.
  </Card>
</Cards>

Stay tuned for the release of this exciting functionality!
