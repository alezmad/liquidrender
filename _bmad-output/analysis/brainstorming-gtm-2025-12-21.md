**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Facilitator:** BMad Master
**Participant:** Agutierrez
**Session Focus:** Go-to-Market Strategy with First Principles + Six Thinking Hats + Guerrilla Tactics

---

## Founder Constraints

| Constraint | Reality | Implication |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Team** | Solo founder | Every action must be high-leverage |
| **Budget** | €0 | Product must be the marketing |
| **Timeline** | 8 weeks to MVP | No perfectionism; ship fast |
| **Audience** | ~500 dev followers on Twitter | Small but targeted; quality > quantity |

**Strategic Requirements:**
- Maximum leverage per action
- Viral by design (product sells itself)
- Community-first (earn attention, don't buy it)

---

## Phase 1: First Principles Thinking

### The Emotional Arc

```
BEFORE LiquidRender:
Frustration → Pressure → Helplessness
"I know there's something here but I can't see it"

AFTER LiquidRender:
Relief → Surprise → Pride
"Look what I made" (in 3 seconds)
```

### Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis

| Job Type | The Job | GTM Implication |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Functional** | "I need a chart for this meeting" | Table stakes, not differentiator |
| **Emotional** | "I want to feel capable without depending on anyone" | Core value proposition |
| **Social** | "I want others to think I'm efficient/professional" | **VIRAL AMPLIFIER** |

**Key Insight:** The Social Job is the viral mechanism. When users share a LiquidRender dashboard, they're saying "look how smart/efficient I am" — and it's TRUE. They did make it. It just took 3 seconds instead of 3 hours.

### The Villain

**Internal Strategy Framework:**
> "Data Gatekeeping" — Your own data is held hostage behind technical skills you don't have.

**Why this villain works:**
- Universal (everyone has felt "I'm not a data person")
- Emotional (creates resentment, desire for liberation)
- Solvable (LiquidRender kills it instantly)

**The Identity Barrier:**
The villain isn't Excel. It isn't Tableau. It isn't time. The villain is the belief: **"I'm not a data person."**

LiquidRender doesn't teach data skills. It eliminates the need for them.

### Strategy vs Messaging Framework

| Layer | Purpose | Content |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Internal (Strategy)** | Guide decisions, maintain coherence | "Democratize access to your own data by killing technical gatekeeping" |
| **External (Messaging)** | Generate emotion, be memorable | "Excel te odia. Nosotros no." / "Drop. See. Done." |

**Internal Strategy Statements:**
- "Gatekeeping tecnico de datos"
- "Democratizar acceso a tus propios datos"
- "Cambio de identidad, no de habilidad"

**External Messaging Candidates:**
- "Excel te odia. Nosotros no."
- "Tu archivo → Tu dashboard → 3 segundos"
- "Deja de luchar con los datos"
- "Your data, finally yours."
- "Look like a data expert. In 3 seconds."

### The Atomic Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   VILLAIN: Technical gatekeeping of your own data          │
│            (externally: "Excel te odia")                   │
│                                                             │
│   HERO:    LiquidRender                                    │
│                                                             │
│   WEAPON:  Drop any file. 3 seconds. Done.                 │
│                                                             │
│   RESULT:  You look like a data expert.                    │
│            (Because now you are one)                       │
│                                                             │
│   VIRAL:   Users share OUTPUT (their dashboard)            │
│            not INPUT (your product)                        │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phrase Candidates (Validated)

| Context | Phrase | Why It Works |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Hero Statement** | "Your data, finally yours." | Implies it was kidnapped |
| **Tagline** | "Drop any file. See what it means." | Action → Result, simple |
| **Viral Hook** | "I made this dashboard in 3 seconds. Seriously." | Disbelief generates clicks |
| **Identity Shift** | "You don't need to be a data person." | Kills villain directly |
| **Visceral/Funny** | "Excel te odia. Nosotros no." | Relatable frustration |

## Phase 2: Six Thinking Hats

### White Hat — Facts

**Market Reality:**
- Excel users globally: ~1.1 billion
- Search volume: ~1.2K/mo "excel to dashboard", ~2.1K "free dashboard maker"
- Competitors: Julius.ai ($20/mo), Rows.com ($9-59), Chartbrew ($29-99), Metabase (free/cloud)
- None have: drop file + connections + voice + document library combined

**Founder Reality:**
- Twitter: ~400 followers (80% devs)
- Email list: 0
- Viral track record: None (max ~50 likes)
- Product built: 0% LiquidRender specific, but TurboStarter complete
- Time: 15-20h/week
- Skills: AI Orchestrator (10x leverage)
- Infrastructure: liquidrender.com + Vercel + full stack ready

**Key Insight:** The constraint is NOT development. It's distribution.

### Red Hat — Emotions

**The María Story (10:47 PM):**
- Laptop on dining table, 14 tabs open
- 3 hours with same Excel
- Boss wants "visualized numbers" for 9 AM tomorrow
- Tried Tableau (2GB download), ChatGPT (gave Python code)
- Physical: Jaw clenched, shoulder tension
- Thought: "This shouldn't be this hard. I HAVE the data."
- Feeling: Helplessness. Loneliness. Everyone else knows something she doesn't.

**The Magic Moment:**
- Drags Excel to LiquidRender. No hope.
- 2 seconds. Dashboard appears. Beautiful. HER data.
- Face: Mouth opens. Eyebrows up. Blinks twice.
- Says out loud: "Wait... what?" then "No fucking way."
- Physical: Shoulders drop. Relief. Short, disbelieving laugh.
- First impulse: Show the coworker who "knows data"

**Founder Emotion:**
- Excitement: This SHOULD exist
- Fear: No one will find it
- Pride: Liquid UI concept feels important
- Doubt: Am I the one to build this?
- Urgency: If I don't, someone else will — and worse

**Mission:** "No one should feel stupid for not knowing how to make a chart."

### Yellow Hat — Optimism

**Dream Scenario (8 weeks out):**
- Week 1-2: MVP built
- Week 3: 30-sec video posted, 5K views, 200 waitlist signups
- Week 4: 50K follower retweets, waitlist jumps to 2,000
- Week 5: Product Hunt #4, 600 upvotes, 3,500 signups
- Week 6-7: User-generated dashboards spread (LinkedIn consultant post: 50K views)
- Week 8: 8,000 users, 350 paid ($4,200 MRR), 40 B2B waitlist

**Hidden Advantages:**
1. I AM the user (María's story is my story)
2. AI Orchestrator + TurboStarter = 10x development speed
3. Liquid UI is bigger than the product (B2B/API/protocol potential)
4. €0 budget forces product quality (can't buy mediocre users)
5. Stable job = no desperation, can play long game
6. No audience but authentic STORY

**Tailwinds:**
1. AI fatigue + hunger for AI that "just works"
2. Excel isn't going anywhere (1.1B users growing)
3. Remote work = more DIY reporting
4. No-code normalized ("make X without knowing Y")
5. Creator/consultant economy needs to look pro
6. Visual content dominates social (dashboards = shareable)
7. Product Hunt/Show HN hungry for real products

### Black Hat — Risks

**External Killers:**
- Microsoft "Excel Copilot Dashboards" (LIKELY but not fatal — they're single-source)
- Julius.ai pivots similar (defense: depth of integration)
- Market doesn't understand differentiation (defense: demo shows POWER)

**Internal Killers:**
- Burnout (15-20h/week + full-time job) — HIGHEST RISK
- Scope creep (connections, MCP, voice, library...)
- Complexity paralysis
- Defense: MVP = drop file ONLY. Everything else = "coming soon"

**Product Killers:**
- Latency with multi-source (defense: progressive loading, cache)
- Connections fail in production (defense: graceful degradation)
- Complexity kills the magic (defense: TWO TRACKS — Simple vs Power)
- API costs higher than expected (defense: limited free tier, cache)

**Worst Realistic Failure:**
- Showed too much too soon
- "Looks complicated" feedback
- 180 users, 2 paid, -$96/month
- **Lesson: Showed ceiling before building stairs**

**Golden Rule:**
> First make María say "wow" with an Excel.
> THEN show her she can also connect Stripe.
> Not the other way around.

### Green Hat — Creative Ideas

**The 30-Second Video:**
```
0-3s:   Black screen. "11:47 PM" appears
3-8s:   Ugly Excel, nervous cursor, failed chart. "3 hours on this"
8-12s:  Browser opens liquidrender.com. "Tried something"
12-18s: File drops. 2-second spinner.
18-25s: BOOM. Beautiful dashboard. Same data. No text needed.
25-28s: Click "Share". Link copied. "3 seconds"
28-30s: Logo. "Your data, finally yours."
```

**Top Tweet Candidates:**

1. **Controversy:**
> Excel isn't the problem. YOU aren't the problem. Visualization tools are.
> 3 hours → 3 seconds. [video]

2. **Identification (BEST):**
> It's 11 PM. Your boss wants "the numbers visualized" by tomorrow.
> You've been fighting Excel for 3 hours.
> This shouldn't exist in 2025.
> So I built this. [video]

3. **Challenge:**
> Send me your worst Excel. Ugliest. Messiest.
> I'll send back a dashboard in 3 seconds.
> Not kidding. liquidrender.com [video]

4. **Humor:**
> Stages of making an Excel chart:
> 1. "This'll be quick"
> 2. "Why does it look like that?"
> 3. "YouTube tutorial time"
> 4. "Maybe Tableau..."
> 5. "It's 2 AM"
> 6. "I'll send it ugly"
>
> There's another way: [video]

**Guerrilla Distribution (Where María is at 10 PM):**
- r/excel (500K members, actively frustrated)
- r/accounting, r/smallbusiness, r/consulting
- LinkedIn (personal story format, video at end)
- Facebook groups (local entrepreneurs, "Excel Tips")
- YouTube comments on "Excel dashboard tutorial" videos
- TikTok/Reels (30-sec format is perfect)

**Wild Ideas:**

1. **@ExcelRoast** — Account that "roasts" ugly Excels by transforming them. Infinite content. Each post = demo.

2. **Dashboard Roulette** — Landing page button shows random user dashboards. See range without uploading.

3. **"Ugliest Excel" Contest** — $100 prize. Generates content + proves it works with anything.

4. **Trojan Horse** — Free tier watermark: "Made with LiquidRender — Your company needs this?" María shares internally → B2B lead.

5. **Live Counter** — "14,847 dashboards created. 47,291 hours saved."

6. **"Letter to 11 PM Me"** — Blog post/thread. Vulnerable storytelling. Product as resolution.

7. **Dashboard for a Coffee** — In-person at cafes/coworkings. "Give me your ugliest Excel. Free dashboard while you drink." Capture reactions on video.

**Priority Ranking:**

| Idea | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 30s Video + Tweet #2 | HIGH | LOW | #1 |
| @ExcelRoast account | HIGH | MED | #2 |
| Reddit guerrilla | MED | LOW | #3 |
| Dashboard Roulette | MED | MED | #4 |
| Ugliest Excel contest | HIGH | MED | #5 |
| LinkedIn story | MED | LOW | #6 |
| Cafe in-person | HIGH | HIGH | Last resort |
