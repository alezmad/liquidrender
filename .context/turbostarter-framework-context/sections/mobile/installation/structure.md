# Project structure

The main directories in the project are:

* `apps` - the location of the main apps
* `packages` - the location of the shared code and the API

### `apps` Directory

This is where the apps live. It includes web app (Next.js), mobile app (React Native - Expo), and the browser extension (WXT - Vite + React). Each app has its own directory.

### `packages` Directory

This is where the shared code and the API for packages live. It includes the following:

* shared libraries (database, mailers, cms, billing, etc.)
* shared features (auth, mails, billing, ai etc.)
* UI components (buttons, forms, modals, etc.)

All apps can use and reuse the API exported from the packages directory. This makes it easy to have one, or many apps in the same codebase, sharing the same code.
