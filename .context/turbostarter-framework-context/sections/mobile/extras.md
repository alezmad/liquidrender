## Tips and Tricks

In many places, next to the code you will find some marketing tips, design suggestions, and potential risks. This is to help you build a better product and avoid common pitfalls.

```tsx title="Hero.tsx"
return (
  <header>
    {/* 💡 Use something that user can visualize e.g. 
    "Ship your startup while on the toilet" */}
    <h1>Best startup on the world</h1>
  </header>
);
```

### Submission tips

When it comes to mobile app and browser extension, you must submit your product to review from Apple/Google etc. We have some tips for you to make sure your submission goes smoothly.

```json title="app.json"
{
  "ios": {
    "infoPlist": {
      /* 🍎 add descriptive justification of using this permission on iOS */
      "NSCameraUsageDescription": "This app uses the camera to scan barcodes on event tickets."
    }
  }
}
```

As well as providing you with the info on how to make your store listings better:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "manifest": {
    /* 💡 Use localized messages to get more visibility in web stores */
    "name": "__MSG_extensionName__",
    "default_locale": "en"
  }
}
```
