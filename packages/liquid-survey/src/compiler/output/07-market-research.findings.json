    "Slider configuration preserved with full parameters: min, max, step, showValue",
    "Required field markers (*) correctly applied to 6 of 8 questions",
    "Inline comments preserved to mark branching sections and flow structure",
    "Multi-choice question (features-used) has 6 options all preserved",
