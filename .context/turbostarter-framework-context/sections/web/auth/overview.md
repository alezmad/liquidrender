# Overview

TurboStarter uses [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com) to handle authentication. It's a secure, production-ready authentication solution that integrates seamlessly with many frameworks and provides enterprise-grade security out of the box.

<Callout title="Why Better Auth?">
  One of the core principles of TurboStarter is to do things **as simple as possible**, and to make everything **as performant as possible**.

  Better Auth provides an excellent developer experience with minimal configuration required, while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards. Its framework-agnostic approach and focus on performance makes it the perfect choice for TurboStarter.

  Recently, Better Auth [announced](https://www.better-auth.com/blog/authjs-joins-better-auth) an incorporation of [Auth.js (27k+ stars on Github)](https://authjs.dev/), making it even more powerful and flexible.

You can read more about Better Auth in the [official documentation](https://better-auth.com/docs).

TurboStarter supports multiple authentication methods:

* **Password** - the traditional email/password method
* **Magic Link** - magic links
* **Passkey** - passkeys ([WebAuthn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API))
* **Anonymous** - allowing users to proceed anonymously
* **OAuth** - OAuth social providers ([Apple](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/apple), [Google](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google) and [Github](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/github) preconfigured)

As well as common applications flows, with ready-to-use views and components:

* **Sign in** - sign in with email/password or OAuth providers
* **Sign up** - sign up with email/password or OAuth providers
* **Sign out** - sign out
* **Password recovery** - forgot and reset password
* **Email verification** - verify email

You can construct your auth flow like LEGO bricks - plug in needed parts and customize them to your needs.
