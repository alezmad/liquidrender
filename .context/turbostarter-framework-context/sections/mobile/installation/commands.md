# Common commands

<Callout>
  For sure, you don't need these commands to kickstart your project, but it's useful to know they exist for when you need them.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Want shorter commands?">
  You can set up aliases for these commands in your shell configuration file. For example, you can set up an alias for `pnpm` to `p`:

  ```bash title="~/.bashrc"
  alias p='pnpm'
  ```

  Or, if you're using [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), you can add the alias to `~/.zshrc`:

  ```bash title="~/.zshrc"
  alias p='pnpm'
  ```

  Then run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.

  You can now use `p` instead of `pnpm` in your terminal. For example, `p i` instead of `pnpm install`.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Injecting environment variables">
  To inject environment variables into the command you run, prefix it with `with-env`:

  ```bash
  pnpm with-env <command>
  ```

  For example, `pnpm with-env pnpm build` will run `pnpm build` with the environment variables injected.

  Some commands, like `pnpm dev`, automatically inject the environment variables for you.
</Callout>

## Installing dependencies

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Starting development server

Start development server by running:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building project

To build the project (including all apps and packages), run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Building specific app/package

To build a specific app/package, run:

```bash
pnpm turbo build --filter=<package-name>
```

## Cleaning project

To clean the project, run:

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Then, reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Formatting code

To check for formatting errors using Prettier, run:

```bash
pnpm format
```

To fix formatting errors using Prettier, run:

```bash
pnpm format:fix
```

## Linting code

To check for linting errors using ESLint, run:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

To fix linting errors using ESLint, run:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

## Typechecking

To typecheck the code using TypeScript for any type errors, run:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

## Adding UI components

<Tabs items={["Web", "Mobile"]}>
  <Tab value="Web">
    To add a new web component, run:

    ```bash
    pnpm --filter @turbostarter/ui-web ui:add
    ```

    This command will add and export a new component to `@turbostarter/ui-web` package.
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Mobile">
    To add a new mobile component, run:

    ```bash
    pnpm --filter @turbostarter/ui-mobile ui:add
    ```

    This command will add and export a new component to `@turbostarter/ui-mobile` package.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Services commands

<Callout title="Prerequisite: Docker installed">
  To run the services containers locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

  You can always use the cloud-hosted solution (e.g. [Neon](https://neon.tech/), [Turso](https://turso.tech/) for database) for your projects.
</Callout>

We have a few commands to help you manage the services containers (for local development).

### Starting containers

To start the services containers, run:

```bash
pnpm services:start
```

It will run all the services containers. You can check their configs in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Setting up services

To setup all the services, run:

```bash
pnpm services:setup
```

It will start all the services containers and run necessary setup steps.

### Stopping containers

To stop the services containers, run:

```bash
pnpm services:stop
```

### Displaying status

To check the status and logs of the services containers, run:

```bash
pnpm services:status
```

### Displaying logs

To display the logs of the services containers, run:

```bash
pnpm services:logs
```

### Database commands

We have a few commands to help you manage the database leveraging [Drizzle CLI](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands).

#### Generating migrations

To generate a new migration, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env turbo db:generate
```

It will create a new migration `.sql` file in the `packages/db/migrations` folder.

#### Running migrations

To run the migrations against the db, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:migrate
```

It will apply all the pending migrations.

#### Pushing changes directly

<Callout type="warn" title="Don't mess up with your schema!">
  Make sure you know what you're doing before pushing changes directly to the db.
</Callout>

To push changes directly to the db, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:push
```

It lets you push your schema changes directly to the database and omit managing SQL migration files.

#### Checking database status

To check the status of the database, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:status
```

It will display the status of the applied migrations and the pending ones.

```bash
Applied migrations:
- 0000_cooing_vargas
- 0001_curious_wallflower
- 0002_good_vertigo
- 0003_peaceful_devos
- 0004_fat_mad_thinker
- 0005_yummy_bucky
- 0006_glorious_vargas

Pending migrations:
- 0007_nebulous_havok
```

#### Resetting database

To reset the database, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:reset
```

It will reset the database to the initial state.

#### Seeding database

To seed the database with some example data (for development purposes), run:

```bash
pnpm with-env turbo db:seed
```

It will populate your database with some example data.

#### Checking database

To check the database schema consistency, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:check
```

#### Studying database

To study the database schema in the browser, run:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:studio
```

This will start the Studio on [https://local.drizzle.studio](https://local.drizzle.studio).

## Tests commands

### Running tests

To run the tests, run:

```bash
pnpm test
```

This will run all the tests in the project using Turbo tasks. As it leverages Turbo caching, it's [recommended](/docs/web/tests/unit#configuration) to run it in your CI/CD pipeline.

### Running tests projects

To run tests for all Vitest [Test Projects](https://vitest.dev/guide/projects), run:

```bash
pnpm test:projects
```

This will run all the tests in the project using Vitest.

### Watching tests

To watch the tests, run:

```bash
pnpm test:projects:watch
```

This will watch the tests for all [Test Projects](https://vitest.dev/guide/projects) and run them automatically when you make changes.

### Generating code coverage

To generate code coverage report, run:

```bash
pnpm turbo test:coverage
```

This will generate a code coverage report in the `coverage` directory under `tooling/vitest` package.

### Viewing code coverage

To preview the code coverage report in the browser, run:

```bash
pnpm turbo test:coverage:view
```

This will launch the report's `.html` file in your default browser.
