Please ensure the summary is clear and well-structured: The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and innovation during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and quickly spread throughout Western Europe and North America. This period saw the mechanization of manufacturing, development of factory systems, and significant technological innovations in areas like textile production, steam power, and transportation. It led to major social changes including urbanization, the rise of a new working class, and eventual improvements in living standards. However, it also brought challenges like poor working conditions, child labor, and environmental pollution."
