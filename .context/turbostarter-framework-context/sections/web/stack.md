# Tech Stack

## Turborepo

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) is a monorepo tool that helps you manage your project's dependencies and scripts. We chose a monorepo setup to make it easier to manage the structure of different features and enable code sharing between different packages.

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is one of the most popular [React](https://react.dev) frameworks that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. We chose Next.js for its flexibility and ease of use. We're also using it to host our serverless API.

## Hono & React Query

[Hono](https://hono.dev) is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the edge. It provides tools to help you build APIs and web applications faster. It includes an RPC client for making type-safe function calls from the frontend. We use Hono to build our serverless API endpoints.

To make data fetching and caching from our API easy and reliable, we pair Hono with [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). It helps manage asynchronous data, caching, and state synchronization between the client and backend, delivering a fast and seamless UX.

## Better Auth

[Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com) is a modern authentication library for fullstack applications. It provides ready-to-use snippets for features like email/password login, magic links, OAuth providers, and more. We use Better Auth to handle all authentication flows in our application.

## Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework that helps you build custom designs without writing any CSS. We also use [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com) for our headless components library and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), which enables you to generate pre-designed components with a single command.

## Drizzle

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is a super fast [ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for databases. It helps manage databases, generate TypeScript types from your schema, and run queries in a fully type-safe way.

We use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as our default database, but thanks to Drizzle's flexibility, you can easily switch to MySQL, SQLite or any [other supported database](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/connect-overview) by updating a few configuration lines.
