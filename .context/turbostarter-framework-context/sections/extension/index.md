## Principles

TurboStarter is built with the following principles:

* **As simple as possible** - It should be easy to understand, easy to use, and strongly avoid overengineering things.
* **As few dependencies as possible** - It should have as few dependencies as possible to allow you to take full control over every part of the project.
* **As performant as possible** - It should be fast and light without any unnecessary overhead.

## Features

Before diving into the technical details, let's overview the features TurboStarter provides.

## Use like LEGO blocks

The biggest advantage of TurboStarter is its modularity. You can use the entire stack or just the parts you need. It's like LEGO blocks - you can build anything you want with it.

If you don't need a specific feature, feel free to remove it without affecting the rest of the stack.

This approach allows for:

* **Easy feature integration** - plug new features into the kit with minimal changes.
* **Simplified maintenance** - keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
* **Core feature separation** - distinguish between core features and custom features.
* **Additional modules** - easily add modules like billing, CMS, monitoring, logger, mailer, and more.
