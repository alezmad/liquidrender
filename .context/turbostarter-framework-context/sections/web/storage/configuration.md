# Configuration

Currently, TurboStarter supports all S3-compatible storage providers, including [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces), [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/), and [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/storage).

For a concrete example using Supabase Storage as an S3-compatible provider, see the [Supabase recipe](/docs/web/recipes/supabase#use-supabase-storage-as-s3-compatible-storage).

The setup process is straightforward - you just need to configure a few environment variables in both your local environment and hosting provider:

```dotenv
S3_REGION=
S3_BUCKET=
S3_ENDPOINT=
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

Let's break down each required variable:

* `S3_REGION`: The [AWS region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/) where your storage is located - defaults to `us-east-1`
* `S3_BUCKET`: The default name of your storage bucket - you can pass different for each request
* `S3_ENDPOINT`: The S3 [endpoint URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html) for your storage provider - defaults to `https://s3.amazonaws.com`
* `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your storage provider's [access key ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)
* `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your storage provider's [secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)

You can learn more about S3 service configuration in the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html) or your specific storage provider's documentation.
