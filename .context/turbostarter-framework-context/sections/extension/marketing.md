# Marketing

As you saw in the [Extras](/docs/extension/extras) section, TurboStarter comes with a lot of tips and tricks to make your product better and help you launch your extension faster with higher traffic.

The same applies to [submission tips](/docs/extension/extras#submission-tips) to help you get your extension approved by the browser stores faster.

We'll talk more about the whole process of deploying and publishing your extension in the [Publishing](/docs/extension/publishing/checklist) section, here we'll go through some guidelines that you need to follow to make your store's visibility higher.

## Before you submit

To help your extension approval go as smoothly as possible, review the common missteps listed below that can slow down the review process or trigger a rejection. This doesn't replace the official guidelines or guarantee approval, but making sure you can check every item on the list is a good start.

Make sure you:

* Test your extension thoroughly for crashes and bugs
* Ensure that all extension information and metadata is complete and accurate
* Update your contact information in case the review team needs to reach you
* Provide clear instructions on how to use your extension, including any special setup required
* If your extension requires an account, provide a demo account or a way to test all features without signing up
* Enable and test all backend services to ensure they're live and accessible during review
* Include detailed explanations of non-obvious features in the extension description
* Ensure your extension complies with the specific browser store's policies (e.g., [Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/best-practices), [Firefox Add-ons](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/add-on-policies/), [Edge Add-ons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/microsoft-edge/extensions/developer-policies) etc.)
* Remove any references to features not supported in browser extensions (e.g., in-app purchases)

Following these basic steps during development and before submission will help you get your extension approved faster and with fewer issues.

## Guidelines

Each store has slightly different guidelines, but some of them are general and can be applied to all stores:

* **Security**: Your extension must not contain malicious code or behavior that can harm users' devices or data.
* **Performance**: Your extension must be performant and stable, with a smooth user experience.
* **Privacy**: Your extension must respect user privacy and not collect unnecessary data without explicit consent.
* **Compliance**: Your extension must comply with all relevant laws and regulations.

You can read more about official guidelines for each store in the following links:

* [Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/best-practices)
* [Firefox Add-ons](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/publish/add-on-policies/)
* [Edge Add-ons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions/developer-guide/best-practices)

## Common mistakes

There are a few common mistakes that you should avoid to make sure your extension can be accepted in the stores. The most common ones are:

* **Not enough description** - make sure to describe all the features of your extension and how it works in your store listing, that way users won't be confused about what your extension does. Also include detailed information in the single purpose field regarding your extension's primary functionality.
* **Privacy issues** - respect user privacy and require as least permissions as possible, don't ask for permissions that are not necessary for your extension to work
* **Customer support** - provide a way to contact you in case the user has any issues with your extension
* **Stay up-to-date** - keep your extension and its documentation up-to-date to ensure a smooth user experience and to prevent issues during the review process.
