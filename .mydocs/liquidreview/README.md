# LiquidCode v2 Review Suite

**Generated:** 2025-12-21
**Purpose:** Parallel expert review of LiquidCode v2 specification documents

## Documents Under Review

| Document | Path | Lines |
|----------|------|-------|
| SPEC | `.mydocs/liquidcode/LIQUIDCODE-SPEC-v2.md` | ~2,543 |
| PRD | `_bmad-output/prd-liquid-engine-v2.md` | ~1,452 |
| RATIONALE | `.mydocs/liquidcode/LIQUIDCODE-RATIONALE-v2.md` | ~1,416 |

## Review Dimensions

Each review file targets a specific dimension:

| File | Dimension | Focus |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `01-implementation-gaps.md` | Implementation Gaps | Unspecified behaviors, missing interfaces, LLM prompt gaps |
| `02-spec-internal-consistency.md` | SPEC Internal | Self-contradictions within SPEC |
| `03-prd-internal-consistency.md` | PRD Internal | Self-contradictions within PRD |
| `04-rationale-internal-consistency.md` | RATIONALE Internal | Self-contradictions within RATIONALE |
| `05-cross-document-consistency.md` | Cross-Document | Conflicts between SPEC, PRD, RATIONALE |
| `06-simplification-opportunities.md` | Simplification | Remove complexity without losing capability |
| `07-architectural-soundness.md` | Architecture | First-principles defensibility |
| `08-edge-cases-failure-modes.md` | Edge Cases | Boundary conditions, failure scenarios |
| `09-extensibility-evolution.md` | Extensibility | Future growth without breaking changes |
| `10-developer-experience.md` | DX | Implementability, clarity, ergonomics |

## Review Protocol

1. Each review is independent and non-overlapping
2. Reviews identify issues but do NOT modify source documents
3. After all reviews complete, synthesize into action items
4. Apply changes to source documents in coordinated batch
