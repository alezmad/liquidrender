# Overview

For AI integration, TurboStarter leverages the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction), which provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities to help you build AI applications more easily and efficiently.

<Callout title="Why Vercel AI SDK?">
  It's a simple yet powerful library that exposes a unified API for all major AI providers.

  This allows you to build your AI application without worrying about the intricacies of each underlying provider's API.
</Callout>

You can learn more about the `ai` package in the [official documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction).

## Features

The starter comes with the most common AI features built-in, such as:

* **Chat**: Build chat applications with ease.
* **Streaming responses**: Stream responses from your AI provider in real-time.
* **Image generation**: Generate images using AI technology.
* **Embeddings**: Generate embeddings for your data.
* **Vector stores**: Store and query your embeddings efficiently.

You can easily compose your application using these building blocks or extend them to suit your specific needs.

## Providers

**TurboStarter relies on the AI SDK to provide support for various AI providers.**

This means you can easily switch between different AI providers without changing your code, as long as they are supported by the `ai` package.

You can find the list of supported providers in the [official documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers).

<Callout title="Custom providers">
  There is also the possibility to add your own custom provider. It just needs to implement the common interface and provide all the necessary methods.

  Read more about this in the [official guide](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/community-providers/custom-providers).
</Callout>

The configuration for each provider is straightforward and simple. We'll explore this in more detail in the [Configuration](/docs/web/ai/configuration) section.
