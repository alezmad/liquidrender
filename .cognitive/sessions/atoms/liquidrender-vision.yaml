# Core Insight
insight: |
  LiquidRender is not a BI tool. It's the data scientist every company
  wants but can't afford. It doesn't wait for questions — it delivers
  briefings. It doesn't show dashboards — it tells stories.

# The Paradigm Shift
shift:
  from: "Build dashboards, write queries, discover insights"
  to: "Connect data, receive briefings, ask anything"

# The Three Modes
modes:
  proactive:
    description: "Morning briefing delivered without asking"
    example: "Revenue up 8%. Churn spiked. Here's why. Here's what to do."

  conversational:
    description: "Natural language Q&A with context"
    example: "'Revenue last quarter?' → '$4.2M, up 12% YoY, driven by Enterprise.'"

  exploratory:
    description: "Collaborative deep-dive when needed"
    example: "Why? → Show by region → Compare to last year → Correlate with spend"

# The Intelligence Stack
architecture:
  interface: "Briefings, Conversations, Explorations"
  brain: "Context + Memory + Reasoning"
  connect: "Vocabulary + Resolution + Query Engine"
  data: "Any database, any source"

# Vocabulary as Invisible Infrastructure
vocabulary:
  old_frame: "Configuration file user creates and manages"
  new_frame: "Institutional knowledge that emerges and evolves"
  visibility: "Only surfaces at friction points (ambiguity, missing definition, drift)"

# The Learning Journey
learning:
  day_1: "Instant understanding from schema"
  day_7: "Pattern recognition from usage"
  day_30: "Anticipation of needs"
  day_90: "Proactive intelligence"
  day_365: "Institutional memory"

# Competitive Position
positioning:
  tableau_powerbi: "You build, you query → Briefings delivered"
  thoughtspot: "You search, it answers → It anticipates, it briefs"
  unique: "Proactive + Intelligent + Learning"

# The Tagline
tagline: "The data scientist every company deserves"
