# Setup Cognitive Context Framework

You've been asked to set up the Cognitive Context Framework for this project.

## What This Is

The Cognitive Context Framework gives you (the AI) persistent memory and structured understanding of this codebase. After setup, you'll have:

- **Orientation**: Always-loaded identity, structure, and constraints
- **Wisdom files**: Cached patterns that load when relevant
- **Entity index**: Quick lookups for components, models, endpoints

## Your Protocol

Read and follow `ONBOARDING-AGENT.md` in this directory.

**Quick summary:**

1. **Safety**: Check git status, create checkpoint, backup existing files
2. **Discovery**: Actually READ the codebase - don't just pattern match
3. **Interview**: Ask SPECIFIC questions based on what you found
4. **Generate**: Create tailored orientation, wisdom, and indices
5. **Validate**: Show what was created, invite refinement

## Key Principles

- **Read code, don't guess**: Open files and understand patterns
- **Be specific**: "I see you use X pattern in Y file" not "What's your pattern?"
- **Quality over quantity**: Few good wisdom files > many generic ones
- **Under 300 tokens**: Orientation must be concise

## Start Now

Begin with Phase 1 (Safety) from the onboarding protocol.
