# Installation

## Cannot clone the repository

Issues related to cloning the repository are usually related to a Git misconfiguration in your local machine. The commands displayed in this guide using SSH: these will work only if you have setup your SSH keys in Github.

If you run into issues, [please make sure you follow this guide to set up your SSH key in Github.](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

If this also fails, please use HTTPS instead. You will be able to see the commands in the repository's Github page under the "Clone" dropdown.

Please also make sure that the account that accepted the invite to TurboStarter, and the locally connected account are the same.

## My environment variables from `.env.local` file are not being loaded

Make sure you are running the `pnpm dev` command from the root directory of your project (where the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file is located)

Also, ensure that the `.env.local` files are present in the apps that need them. For example, the `.env` file should be present in the `apps/web` directory for the web app.

<Callout>
  TurboStarter uses the `dotenv-cli` to load environment variables from a `.env` files. The `dotenv-cli` is automatically used when running the `pnpm dev` command from the root directory.

## Next.js server doesn't start

This may happen due to some issues in the packages. Try to clean the workspace using the following command:

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Then, reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

You can now retry running the dev server.

## Local database doesn't start

If you cannot run the local database container, it's likely you have not started [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) locally. Our local database requires Docker to be installed and running.

Please make sure you have installed Docker (or compatible software such as [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima), [Orbstack](https://github.com/orbstack/orbstack)) and that is running on your local machine.

Also, make sure that you have enough [memory and CPU allocated](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/resource_constraints/) to your Docker instance.

## I don't see my translations

If you don't see your translations appearing in the application, there are a few common causes:

1. Check that your translation `.json` files are properly formatted and located in the correct directory
2. Verify that the language codes in your configuration match your translation files
3. Enable debug mode (`debug: true`) in your i18next configuration to see detailed logs

[Read more about configuration for translations](/docs/web/internationalization/configuration)

## "Module not found" error

This issue is mostly related to either dependency installed in the wrong package or issues with the file system.

The most common cause is incorrect dependency installation. Here's how to fix it:

1. Clean the workspace:

   ```bash
   pnpm clean
   ```

2. Reinstall the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

If you're adding new dependencies, make sure to install them in the correct package:

```bash
# For main app dependencies
pnpm install --filter web my-package

# For a specific package
pnpm install --filter @turbostarter/ui my-package
```

If the issue persists, please check the file system for any issues.

### Windows OneDrive

OneDrive can cause file system issues with Node.js projects due to its file syncing behavior. If you're using Windows with OneDrive, you have two options to resolve this:

1. Move your project to a location outside of OneDrive-synced folders (recommended)
2. Disable OneDrive sync specifically for your development folder

This prevents file watching and symlink issues that can occur when OneDrive tries to sync Node.js project files.
