# Migrations

You have your schema in place, and you want to apply your changes to the database. TurboStarter provides you a convenient way to do so with pre-configured CLI commands.

## Generating migration

To generate a migration, from the schema you need to run the following command:

```bash
pnpm with-env turbo db:generate
```

This will create a new `.sql` file in the `migrations` directory.

<Callout>
  Drizzle will also generate a `.json` representation of the migration in the `meta` directory, but it's for its internal purposes and you shouldn't need to touch it.
</Callout>

## Applying migrations

To apply the migrations to the database, you need to run the following command:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:migrate
```

This will apply all the migrations that have not been applied yet. If any conflicts arise, you can resolve them by modifying the generated migration file.

## Pushing changes

To push changes directly to the database, you can use the following command:

```bash
pnpm with-env pnpm --filter @turbostarter/db db:push
```

This lets you push your schema changes directly to the database and omit managing SQL migration files.

<Callout type="warn" title="Use with caution!">
  Pushing changes directly to the database (without using migrations) could be risky. Please be careful when using it; we recommend it only for local development and local databases.
