# Emails

## I want to use a different email provider

Of course! You can use any email provider that you want. All you need to do is to implement the `EmailProviderStrategy` and export it in your `index.ts` file.

## My emails are landing in the spam folder

Emails landing in spam folders is a common issue. Here are key steps to improve deliverability:

1. **Configure proper domain setup**:
   * Use a dedicated subdomain for sending emails (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com)
   * Ensure [reverse DNS (PTR) records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ptr-record/) are properly configured
   * Warm up your sending domain gradually

2. **Implement authentication protocols**:
   * Set up [SPF records](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-spf-record/) to specify authorized sending servers
   * Enable [DKIM signing](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dkim-record/) to verify email authenticity
   * Configure [DMARC policies](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-dmarc-record/) to prevent spoofing

3. **Follow deliverability best practices**:
   * Include clear unsubscribe mechanisms in all marketing communications
   * Personalize content appropriately
   * Avoid excessive promotional language and spam triggers
   * Maintain consistent HTML formatting and styling
   * Only include links to verified domains
   * Keep a regular sending schedule
   * Clean your email lists regularly
   * Use double opt-in for new subscribers

4. **Monitor and optimize**:
   * Track key metrics like delivery rates, opens, and bounces
   * Monitor spam complaint rates
   * Review email authentication reports
   * Test emails across different clients and devices
   * Adjust sending practices based on performance data
