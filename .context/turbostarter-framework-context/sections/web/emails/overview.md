# Overview

For mailing functionality, TurboStarter integrates [React Email](https://react.email/docs/introduction) which enables you to build your emails from composable React components.

<Callout title="Why React Email?">
  It's a simple, yet powerful library that allows you to **write your emails in React**.

  It also allows you to use **Tailwind CSS for styling**, which is a huge advantage, as we can share almost everything from the main app with the emails package, keeping them consistent with rest of the app.
</Callout>

You can read more about `react-email` package in the [official documentation](https://react.email/docs/introduction).

## Providers

TurboStarter implements multiple providers for managing and sending emails. To learn more about each provider and how to configure them, see the respective section:

All configuration and setup is built-in with a unified API, so you can switch between providers by simply changing the exports and even introduce your own provider without breaking any sending-related logic.
