# Editor setup

Of course you can use every IDE you like, but you will have the best possible developer experience with this starter kit when using **VSCode-based** editor with the suggested settings and extensions.

## Settings

We have included most recommended settings in the `.vscode/settings.json` file to make your development experience as smooth as possible. It include mostly configs for tools like Prettier, ESLint and Tailwind which are used to enforce some conventions across the codebase. You can adjust them to your needs.

## LLM rules

We exposed a special endpoint that will scan all the docs and return the content as a text file which you can use to train your LLM or put in a prompt. You can find it at [/llms.txt](/llms.txt).

The repository also includes a custom rules for most popular AI editors and agents to ensure that AI completions are working as expected and following our conventions.

### AGENTS.md

We've integrated specific rules that help maintain code quality and ensure AI-assisted completions align with our project standards.

You can find them in the `AGENTS.md` file at the root of the project. This format is a standardized way to instruct AI agents to follow project conventions when generating code and it's used by over **20,000** open-source projects - including [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), [Aider](https://aider.chat/), [Codex from OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/), [Jules from Google](https://jules.ai/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev/), and many others.
